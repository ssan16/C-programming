Project 2: Mini Yahtzee game
The mini Yahtzee game is a game that allows you to roll five dices to get multiple combinations and get as many points as possible.
Each turn, you can save the number you rolled. For example, if you got 1 2 3 4 5 and wanted to save 1 2, you would input 1 1 0 0 0.
The 1 and 2 will remain but the other 3 would be rolled again.

Completion Statement
    Starter code that was attached was very helpful. i am satisfied with the way the project came out. It was a long project with
many functions with the use of arrays which i am familiar with from other programming languages. i started with choosing the functions that i thought
was easier then worked my way to the harder ones.Everything is commented.
